# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
A Chief Data Scientist for a city school district has asked for help to analyze data on student funding and students' standardized test scores. Our role in this project is to aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance. This analysis will aid the city School Board and Superintendent on making decisions regarding the school budget and what to prioritize.
After providing our first analysis, we are informed that there is evidence of academic dishonesty within the reading and math grades for Thomas High School's ninth grade class. This leads us to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School's ninth grade class with "NaN's" while keeping the rest of the data intact.

We are provided with two main datasets:
1. students_complete.csv
2. schools_complete.csv

The students_complete.csv has every student sorted by name and School ID along with which school they attend, their gender, grade, and their reading and math scores.
The schools_complete.csv has each school sorted by School ID and contains information on the size of each school and their budgets.
